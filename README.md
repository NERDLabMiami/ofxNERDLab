==========

This addon lets you use the NERDLab Controller for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nerdlab-controller/id827566722?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dataplayed.nerdlabcontroller.app). The controller is being developed for a massively multiplayer single screen game where you use smart phones as individual controllers. Currently, the control allows for a mixture of touch, accelerometer and audio control.

There are a lot of OSC controllers out there for your smart phone, but the NERDLab Controller comes at it from a game perspective. Install and go if you will.

It's still a work in progress, feedback is very welcome.
